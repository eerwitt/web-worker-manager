# Web Worker Manager

Manage background HTML5 workers in the browser to compute long running intensive tasks.

## Installation

Steps to using this library to manage HTML5 workers.

* Include the library and a copy of `Q`.
* Create your application's main calls to the web worker manager.
* Create a separate script which runs the background tasks.

### Include the library.

Include the `web-worker-manager-v0.1-main.js` on any page in either the `head` or at the close of the `body` tag.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Q promises are used often in this library. -->
    <script src="path/to/q.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="js/web-worker-manager-v0.1-main.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <!-- Add in script which will work with the web-worker-manager. See [main.js] below. -->
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

### Create your application's main calls to the web worker manager.

Create a separate file called `main.js` which will instantiate the web worker manager.

```javascript
// The manager requires the location of the worker code to be passed in. This is the location relative to the current page the browser is on.
// *It is recommended to use an absolute path if possible.
manager = new WebWorkerManager("/js/worker.js");

// #runJob will ask an available worker to execute the code related to a job of the same name. That job will then be sent a message including
// the data which is passed in as a second parameter.
manager.runJob("downcaseWords", {"words": "Hello Who Is this"})
  .then(function(d) {console.log(d);})
  .progress(function(p) {console.info(p);})
  .fail(function(e) {console.error(e);});
```

The `#runJob` method is used for a single job to be ran, it returns a `Q` promise immediately.

If all the workers are already working, the job will be placed in a queue to be picked up by the next available worker.

### Create your application's worker file (worker.js)

The `worker.js` is responsible for the majority of actual code being executed. Each worker will be reused until the manager is shut down or an exception occurs in the worker.

```javascript
// We need to import the script which will provide some default functions to help get the worker setup properly.
importScripts("/js/web-worker-manager-v0.1-worker.js");

// To create a job we give it a name and code to call when it is ran.
// The callbacks given are used to pass back the current status of the job.
//   * progress - notifies of updates towards the final goal.
//   * complete - sends back the payload when the job is done.
//   * error - generates an error which can be captured upstream.
registerJob("downcaseWords", function(params, progress, complete, error) {
  if(params.words === undefined) {
    error("No string supplied");
  }
  words = params.words.split(/\s/);
  total = words.length;
  
  complete(words.map( function(word, i) {
    progress(i, total);

    return word.toLowerCase();
  }));
});
```

## Contibuting

Please do contribute, I appreciate any help.

### Testing

This app relies on `Karma` and is tested using.

`grunt oneshot`.

### Local Development

This project requires `Grunt` to opperate. Most of the code is written in `Coffee`.

```bash
  npm install -g grunt-cli

  # From project directory
  grunt oneshot

  # If all tests passed
  grunt build
```

The project follows a layout of.

```
/
  - test
    - lib
      - worker    // Worker tests
      - manager   // Manager tests
    - examples    // Example code tests
  - lib
    - worker      // Worker related functions
    - manager     // Manager related functions
  - examples      // Example code
```

## Other Libraries

This isn't the only library for managing HTML5 Web Workers I have found. Before making it I looked at some others which didn't work great for me but may be helpful to other people.

If any library I came across had `0` tests, I didn't regard it with any serious attention.

### Links
  * [Catiline.js](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/catiline) My favorite: good documentation, interesting examples, decent test suite and hasn't been updated recently.
  * [Architect](https://github.com/EtienneLem/architect) Interesting: poor documentation, good examples, poor test suite and hasn't been updated recently.
  * [jQuery.Hive](https://github.com/rwaldron/jquery-hive) Surprising: unsure documentation (malware notice in chrome), OK examples, poor test suite and hasn't been updated recently.
  * [Runners.js](https://github.com/tantaman/Runners.js) Very similar: decent documentation, good examples, great test suite and hasn't been updated recently.

## TODO
  * Explore why `karma:unit:run` with `grunt watch` isn't running on successive calls.
  * Create a fallback for browsers which don't support HTML5 `Worker`.
  * Add in general information on currently running jobs.
    * Number of jobs running
    * Number of errors
    * Time for jobs to complete
  * See tests for using [Transferable objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Performance/Using_web_workers#Passing_data_by_transferring_ownership_(transferable_objects))
  * A fallback for browser which do not support HTML5 `Workers` is available but will be ran in an asynchronous manner.
